## Background / About

  For this project the goal was to utilize an Object Oriented Programming paradigm along with Test Driven Development process in order to build a fully functional replica of the game jeopardy. The game will support three players and allows you to select up to 16 clues for the first and second round, and a single clue for the last round. Each round has a daily double or two allowing you to increase your score faster, as well as the final round being in the same style where you wager an amount before seeing what the clue is.
